The conference venue has a maximum capacity of 120 attendees, so please register early to guarantee a place and help with logistics planning!

Please note that all presentations must be given in-person.

We hope to stream the meeting via Zoom for members of the MIST community who are unable to make it to Leicester. This will be on a best effort basis, so virtual attendance will be free. More details about virtual attendance will be provided nearer the time.

## Accommodation
Accommodation should be booked separately to registration. We recommend that you book accommodation at the conference venue, [College Court](https://collegecourt.co.uk/) - the venue has a limited number of rooms reserved for conference attendees, so we recommend booking early!

To book accomodation at College Court, download and fill out the [Bed and Breakfast Booking Form](College_Court_booking_form.pdf), then email it to conferences@le.ac.uk quoting the code `SPRINGMIST 2025`. The venue will then contact you confirming your booking and will send you a payment link using our discounted rate.

## Programme
The first conference session will begin at 12:00 on Monday 7th April, and the last session will end by 15:00 on Wednesday 9th April. We will release a full programme by the end of February, once abstract selection is complete.
