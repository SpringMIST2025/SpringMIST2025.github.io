## Online streaming
We plan to stream the meeting's oral sessions on Zoom for members of the MIST community who are unable to make it to Leicester. This will be on a best effort basis (there may be the odd technical issue!), so online registration is completely free. Please note that all presentations will be given in-person. If you would like a link to the online stream, please contact `springmist2025@gmail.com`.


## Accommodation
Accommodation should be booked separately to registration. We recommend that you book accommodation at the conference venue, College Court - the venue has a limited number of rooms reserved for conference attendees, so we recommend booking early!

To book accomodation at College Court, download and fill out the [Bed and Breakfast Booking Form](College_Court_booking_form.pdf), then email it to `conferences@le.ac.uk` quoting the code `SPRINGMIST 2025`. The venue will then contact you confirming your booking and will send you a payment link using our discounted rate.
